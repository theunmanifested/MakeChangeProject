## Walter's MakeChange (Cash Register) Week 1 Project

### Description

#### Input
This program will take input from the user of the total amount of purchase (max $20.00), and they will also input with how much money they want to pay.

It will check first if the amount is greater than the maximum, and if they have provided enough money to pay for their purchase.
#### Output
After running some calculation, the program will out put the change owed in the following denominations:
* Ten dollar bills
* Five dollar bills
* One dollar bills
* Quarters
* Dimes
* Nickels
* Pennies

### Topics and Technologies Used

* Conditionals: if statements with multiple conditions.
* Looping (for loops): For loops, while loops, do while loops.
* Arrays (in order to print)

### How to Run

javac MakeChange.java
java MakeChange

### Lessons Learned

I learned to use more than just the main method, to use a Do-While when the condition needs to run at least one time, but most importantly I learned about the rounding that happens with double data types. I multiplied them by 100, and then casted them to Integers.
